This is a very simple implementation of our paper:

Binary Multi-View Clustering, 

The details can be found in the TPAMI 2018 paper (release soon). 

This code has been evaluated on Matlab 2013a.

Resources:

We supply the Multi-view Caltech101 dataset, which can be downloaded from the following [baiduyun link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zPA56kNu8ItkFqpzY7IzsA).
