# Binary Multi-View Clustering (BMVC)
This is a very simple implementation of our paper:

#### Binary Multi-View Clustering, 

The details can be found in the [TPAMI 2019 paper](http://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/~fshen/TPAMI-BMVC_Final.pdf). 

This code has been evaluated on Matlab 2013a.

#### Resources:

We supply the Multi-view Caltech101 dataset, which can be downloaded from the [baiduyun link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zPA56kNu8ItkFqpzY7IzsA).
